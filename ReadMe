4. Once the test run finished you can refer the report generated under target->cucumber-report


Implementation Highlights : 

i)  This has been created as a maven project. Dependencies added in POM.XML 
ii) BDD approach is followed : Required Feature file is written with scenarios and respective step definition files are
    created using page object model.
iii) Report - I have used cucumber reports to track test run results.(Please refer 'overview-features.html' for results in
     graphical & tabular form


Improvement scope : 

i) The current test only caters to time entered in seconds only.( we can enter time more than 60 seconds).
ii) The test can be enhanced to enter time in minutes and hours scenarios and other special timers.
